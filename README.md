#Building a Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor

This guide explores how to develop a RISC-V processor using a single-cycle architecture. Each instruction is executed within a single clock cycle, and the design integrates Control and Status Registers (CSR) for robust system-level control and seamless exception handling. The CSR trap mechanism is hardwired for reliable exception management.

Tools and Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

SystemVerilog:
A hardware description language for designing the processor’s architecture.

Text Editor (e.g., VS Code):
Recommended for managing code files. Install SystemVerilog extensions for enhanced functionality.

GTKWave:
For analyzing waveforms generated during simulations. Some features may require Multisim.

Simulation Software:
Tools like ModelSim, Quartus, or Vivado to compile and test the processor design.

Compilation and Simulation Commands

Follow these commands to compile, simulate, and review your processor design:

Compile Design Files:

vlog -work work *.sv

Run the Testbench Simulation:

vsim -c processor_testbench -do "run -all"

Analyze Waveforms:

gtkwave output_waveform.vcd

Step-by-Step Workflow

Setting Up the Project:

Open the project directory using your text editor (e.g., VS Code).

Ensure SystemVerilog extensions are installed for better syntax highlighting and navigation.

Compiling the Design:

Use a simulator like ModelSim or Vivado to compile the SystemVerilog files. Resolve any dependencies before proceeding.

Running Simulations:

Execute the testbench to verify the processor’s operations under various scenarios.

Reviewing Results:

Load the .vcd output file in GTKWave to analyze signal transitions.

Use Multisim if additional functionality is needed for debugging.

Enhancing the Processor:

Implement new instructions to extend the processor’s capabilities.

Test the CSR system by simulating exception handling scenarios.

Key Features of the Design

Efficient Single-Cycle Operation:
Ensures each instruction completes in one clock cycle, simplifying control logic.

Integrated CSR System:
Offers robust system control and streamlined exception handling with hardwired mechanisms.

Expandable Framework:
Enables users to add new RISC-V instructions and experiment with complex behaviors.
